# Sorting-visualizer

# Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based project designed to help users visualize different sorting algorithms through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This tool provides an engaging and educational experience, allowing users to observe the step-by-step process of various sorting algorithms.

# Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project includes a user-friendly GUI that allows users to interact with and observe the sorting algorithms visually.

Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports a range of sorting algorithms, including:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Radix Sort
6. Quick Sort

Real-Time Visualization: Watch sorting algorithms in action as the visualizer animates the sorting process in real-time.

Adjustable Speed: Users can control the speed of the sorting animation, enabling them to slow down or speed up the visualization to match their learning pace.
